# V Ignite Emoji Recognition

	We are in the advanced technology where we can find everything easy,but not in these small things.
	Our idea is a way,where your expressions are captured to predict the emoji.
	We will recommend the emojis and gifs based on the face recognition and speech recognition. 
	Our approach to make this possible is by Face Recognition System by scanning their face at the time when person needs to use emojis. 

	Generally, searching an emoji in the keyboard is difficult.So, by using this face recognition and speech recognition we can get emojis more easily and effectively. 




# Dependencies 

	Scikit learn
	dilb with python support
	opencv
	numpy
	skimage
	python 2.7
	pyAudio

# Speech Recognition


	We have 7 attributes in speech recognition class and in that recognize_google is one of it. 
	We used python modules with pyAudio to recognize the speech and covert it into text and then assigning unicodes of the Emojis by importing the emoji modules


# Face Recogniton

	We had used openCV for accessing WEB cam and capture the emotion and recognize the emoji.
